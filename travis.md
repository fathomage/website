# Summary
With 28 years in the software industry, I have been a core developer, a team lead, an independent consultant, a project manager, a systems architect, and a CTO.  I have worked for tiny startups, small businesses, and large multinationals; in corporate offices, as a traveling consultant, and remotely; in 2 different languages, and on 3 different continents.

In that time I have seen so many things come and goâ€¦
* From DCOM and CORBA to SOA and WS-* to REST and JSON to microservices to serverless apps
* From J2EE and MVC to AJAX and Web 2.0 to Angular and Typescript to React to micro-frontends
* From Solaris to Linux to VMWare to EC2 to Docker to Kubernetes
* From Oracle to MySQL to NoSQL to Blockchain

The only constant in this industry is change!

Having seen so many buzzwords come and go and the tremendous cost sunk into large development projects, I tread carefully when choosing a new platform, library, or language.  It is all too easy to fall into the Shiny New Object trap only to find yourself on an obsolete, unsupported technology just a few years later.  I choose my tools based on their merit and applicability to the task at hand, not on their level of coolness.
